minion - a minimalistic io implementation

This project is the start of a minimal implementation of the io programming
language, or something syntactically similar. It consists of a lexer, a
parser, a hashtable acting as objects and a simple AST traversal. It has no
support for infix operations:

    a + b

is not valid. One has to write

    a +(b)

instead, if a slot + has been added to the type a represents. This is to be
read as "call the method + on a, with the argument b".

Happy hacking.
